We love to go to the movies, to walk around hand in hand, to be with our friends, with our families, to see the sunsets and the moon, to get know new good restaurants and to travel a lot. There are so many countries to see, so many tastes to taste, so many people to meet, so much life to live!

Estudié unos años de arquitectura, me gradué de sociología con un posgrado en desarrollo urbano. Creo que la transformación del mundo generada por el sistema actual, exige una toma de conciencia y la re-construcción de un mundo posible para todos y entre todos.
Lo que más me molesta es la injusticia y la mentira.
Me encanta bailar.
Viajar me parece siempre una oportunidad maravillosa para conocer y aprender sobre otras culturas que forman parte de nosotros mismos.
Cuando viajo me gusta alojarme en un espacio luminoso, limpio y alegre, ojalá en contacto o cerca de la naturaleza, con vistas hermosas. No me gustan los espacios cerrados, oscuros y con demasiados adornos. Disfruto de cada pieza antigua (especialmente) o rústica pero en equilibrio.
Disfruto en general de la buena mesa: la comida mexicana, la peruana, la francesa, la china; comer bien siempre será un buen panorama para mí.

We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""Théâtre a la Dérive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in México.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""Théâtre a la Dérive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in México.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""Théâtre a la Dérive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in México.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

My first experience with Airbnb was in August 2014, as a guest, traveling to Chicago USA.
The experience was very good, so in September 2014 decided to join as a host, offering a couple of options and prices to stay in Mexico City.

I like that the guests enjoy their stay and their space, in total privacy.
My priority is to offer nice, clean, safe and well located place; at a  affordable rate.

I have always lived in Mexico City, I know it very well. It will be a pleasure to guide you and help you with any questions, suggestions that you require, or need that you have.
